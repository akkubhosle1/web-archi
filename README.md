# web-archi
Web-archi fetches URLs from the Wayback Machine's archive that match a given pattern, categorizes them based on their file extensions, 
and saves the URLs to separate files for each file type. The program reads the input URL from standard input, calls the `waybackurls` command-line tool
to fetch the matching URLs.

Install:
 `go install github.com/akkubhosle1/web-archi@latest`
